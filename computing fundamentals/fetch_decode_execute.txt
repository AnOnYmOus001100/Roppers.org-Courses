1. The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle is the cycle that the CPU runs through billions of times per second to make a computer work.
Fetch: the computer retrieves the instruction from main memory and stores in the registers.
Decode: the CPU interprets the instruction and figures out what action to take.
Execute: finally, the CPU performs the action that's required, such as performing calculations.
