Sticky Bit is mainly used on folders in order to avoid deletion of a folder and itâ€™s content by other users though they having write permissions on the folder contents. If Sticky bit is enabled on a folder, the folder contents are deleted by only owner who created them and the root user. No one else can delete other users data in this folder(Where sticky bit is set). This is a security measure to avoid deletion of critical folders and their content(sub-folders and files), though other users have full permissions.
I understood the stuffs so nothing regarging that.
