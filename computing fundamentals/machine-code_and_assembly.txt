1. Machine code: It is composed of zeroes and ones and is read or executed by the CPU. Machine code is low level and is platform dependent, it is not human readable and is understood by computers.
Assembly code: It is a low level programming language which is converted to machine code using a software called an assembler. It uses mnemonics to represent the operations that a processsor has to do and it is platform dependent.
2. Grace hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and used this theory to develop the FLOW-MATIC programming language and COBOL, and early high-level programming language. She was one of the first programmers on the Harvard Mark I computer.
