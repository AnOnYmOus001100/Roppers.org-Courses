1. Drives are located under /dev/DRIVENAME in linux. Most likely it will be called /dev/sda_ but it can be anything else. The linux filesystem is in a standard hierarchical setup.
2. Inodes are the pointers OSs use to give the location of a block of data. Whether it is for a file or a directory, there will be an inode associated with it. These inodes are all stored together in a table towards the front of a file system on a drive. By reading the data located in the inode table, the OS is able to calculate the correct offset into the Data Blocks required to find the file.
3. When you delete a file the inode data that tells us what the LBA leading to the file is will be zero'd out. This means that it no longer is useful to find the block offset. Once this inode table has been zero'd out, whatever block it previously reserved it can now put new data in it, but that does not mean that the data is gone.
4. Metadatea is the information abouta file, it's not the data contained in the file. Metadata is usually kept in front of the file, it is stored inside of the file but is not considered to be part of the file itself.
