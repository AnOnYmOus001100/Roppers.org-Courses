1. /etc/shadow contains the password hashes of the users.
Hashing: Hashes are designed to be mathematically one way, meaning it is impossible to reverse a hash into the data that was used to create it. Hashing functions are algorithms that take in any data, do math on it, and output a string of some set length depending on the function, that can be assumed to be unique to whatever the input was. To put it another way, no two inputs should result in the same output hash.
Salting: Salting is a very cool technique where a computer or website creates a unique string to place at the end of every password entered.
Cracking: Cracking is the practice of hacking computer systems or software with malicious intent. Sometimes it can also means password cracking which means to find the correct password by comparing with a hashed password and a dictionary of already hashed password.

2. field #1: * dennis: This is the username.
field #2: This is the hased or encrypted password.
* $6 : This represents the hasing mechanism to generate the hash from the password.
* $iU9KjTeD : This represents the randomly generated salt used.
* 5myyo4W7zppTOEdVUeP8/E6Kmjl7CtYYFqIIyes.fnNHy1fR0gJLb0q2KLhjAH6KrPpHZ0eJorBh.D74mq.vQ: This is the resulting hash of taking the user's password and the randomly generated salt.
field #3: date of last password change.
field #4: minimum password age.
field #5: maximum password age.
field #6: password warning period.
field #7: password inactivity period.
field #8: account expiration date.
field #9: This field is reserved for future use

3. After creating a new account the password looked normal. After locking the account the password had a '!' in front of it in the /etc/shadow file. After unlocking the account the '!' got removed from the front of the password.
