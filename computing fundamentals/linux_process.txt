1. I ran 'nc -l 1337'. I found the process by typing 'ps -u USER_NAME | grep nc' and I found the PID of the 'nc' process as 7186. Then I 'cd' into /proc/7186 and then 'ls' this gave me a list of the files and directories.

2. We can tell a process is a zombie file by looking at the 'STAT' column and if it is 'Z' then we can tell it is a zombie file.

3. Signals are generated by the OS whereas interrupts are generated by underlying hardware. An interrupt signal is emitted by a device attached to a computer or from a program.

4. systemd is a software suite that provides an array of system components for Linux operating systems. The main aim is to unify service configuration and behavior across Linux distributions.
